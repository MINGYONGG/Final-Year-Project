**Project Overview**

This project focuses on the classification of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) using the MIT-BIH dataset and the Random Forest algorithm. HRV refers to the variation in the time interval between heartbeats and is an important indicator of autonomic nervous system activity and overall cardiovascular health. By analyzing the ECG data from the MIT-BIH dataset, this project aims to detect different HRV patterns and classify them to assess heart health.

The Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method, is used for this classification task. It works by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the most common class among the trees. The project aims to provide an accurate and reliable approach to HRV classification, which could assist in the early detection of potential heart conditions such as arrhythmias or other cardiovascular abnormalities.

**Objective**

1. To classify HRV patterns in ECG data using the MIT-BIH dataset.

2. To apply a Random Forest classifier that can identify and differentiate HRV patterns.

3. To provide insights into cardiovascular health based on HRV analysis.

**Features**

1. Random Forest Classification: Uses Random Forest, a robust machine learning technique, to classify HRV patterns from ECG data.

2. MIT-BIH Dataset: The project uses the publicly available MIT-BIH dataset, a well-established resource in the field of heart health monitoring.

3. Feature Extraction: Key features are extracted from the ECG data to train the model for accurate classification.

4. Accuracy Evaluation: Performance is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure model robustness.


**How to Get the MIT-BIH Dataset**
You can obtain the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which is used in this project, in two ways:

**1. Downloading from the Official Website**

a) You can visit the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database webpage to download the dataset manually. Here's a step-by-step guide:

b) Go to the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

c) Click on the "Download" section.

d) Choose the desired format (typically the "PhysioBank ATM" format).

e) Download the dataset zip files to your local directory.

f) Once the files are downloaded, extract them and place them in a directory for your project.


**2. Automatically Downloading Using Python Code**

You can also use the following Python code to automatically download the MIT-BIH dataset if it's not already on your machine:

import os

import wfdb 

download_dir = '/mitdb_data'


if not os.path.exists(download_dir) or not os.listdir(download_dir):

    wfdb.dl_database('mitdb', dl_dir=download_dir)
    
    print("Download complete.")
    
else:

    print("Dataset already exists.")
